## 🚀 **Stop Building Static Visual Novels. Start Creating Interactive Experiences.**

**Your players deserve more than click-to-continue storytelling.** 

Snatchernauts Framework is the **only Ren'Py framework** engineered from the ground up to deliver the exploration-rich, tactile gameplay that made classics like _Snatcher_ and _Policenauts_ legendary. 

**The result?** Visual novels that feel less like digital books and more like **living, breathing worlds** your players can truly explore.

### 🎯 **Built for Developers Who Demand More**

Tired of the limitations of traditional visual novel frameworks? **Snatchernauts delivers everything you need** to create next-generation interactive experiences:

✅ **Pixel-perfect interaction** — No more clunky rectangular hitboxes  
✅ **Professional-grade visual effects** — CRT shaders, bloom, letterboxing, film grain  
✅ **Multi-input support** — Mouse, keyboard, and gamepad out of the box  
✅ **Clean, extensible architecture** — Write less code, accomplish more  
✅ **Production-ready tooling** — Built-in debugging, automated builds, CI/CD ready

***

## 🎆 **The Problem with Traditional Visual Novels**

**95% of visual novels suffer from the same limitation:** They're essentially digital books with pictures. Players click → read text → click again. **That's it.**

**But what if your visual novel could:**
- Let players **explore environments** like real detective games?
- Feature **dynamic, contextual interactions** that respond to player curiosity?
- Deliver **cinematic visual effects** that rival AAA productions?
- Support **multiple input methods** for maximum accessibility?
- Provide **professional-grade development tools** that accelerate your workflow?

### 💡 **The Snatchernauts Solution: Interactive Immersion**

**Snatchernauts Framework is the answer.** We've taken everything that made legendary interactive fiction unforgettable and engineered it into a modern, production-ready framework.

**What makes us different:**

🎯 **Pixel-Perfect Exploration**  
    No more rectangular hitboxes. Players click only on actual objects, creating natural, intuitive interaction.

🧭 **Context-Aware Interactions**  
    Dynamic menus that change based on story progress, inventory, and player actions.

🧩 **Professional Architecture**  
    Clean separation of concerns. Write game logic once, use everywhere. No more spaghetti code.

🎬 **Hollywood-Grade Visual Effects**  
    Real-time shader effects: CRT monitors, film grain, atmospheric fog, dynamic lighting.

🕶️ **Live Visual Tuning**  
    Adjust bloom, vignette, scanlines, and color grading in real-time during development.

**Result:** Visual novels that feel like **living, breathing worlds** instead of static storybooks.

## 🌟 **What You Get with Snatchernauts**

### ✨ Features at a Glance

| Feature                    | What it gives you                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎯 Pixel‑accurate hotspots | Click only where the image is opaque; no sloppy hitboxes |
| 🧭 Keyboard/gamepad nav    | Fast navigation across in‑room objects                   |
| 🗂️ Contextual menus       | Examine, Use, Talk, and custom actions                   |
| 🧩 Centralized hooks       | on\_game\_start, on\_room\_enter, on\_object\_\* events  |
| 🛠️ Debug overlay          | Live logging toggles, FPS/memory hints                   |
| 🕶️ CRT + vignette         | Warp/scan/chroma + horizontal vignette, live tuning      |
| 🎬 Shader system           | Film grain, fog, lighting, letterbox via GLSL shaders    |
| 🌸 Bloom effects           | Cinematic overlays with color correlation                |
| 🧰 Clean APIs              | room/display/ui/interactions modules                     |

### How It Works (Architecture)

* Coordinator: `game/script.rpy` starts the info overlay, then calls `on_game_start()` and enters the exploration loop via `play_room()`.
* Public APIs: `game/api/*.rpy` expose helpers for rooms, display/effects, UI, and interactions.
* Logic Layer: put your gameplay in `game/logic/game_logic.rpy` and optional `game/logic/rooms/<room>_logic.rpy` files. Register per‑room handlers.
* UI Layer: screens under `game/ui/` compose descriptions, menus, and overlays.
* Effects: `game/shaders/` and `game/overlays/` provide CRT/Bloom/Letterbox and startup/debug overlays.
* Core Config: `game/core/` contains options, logging, and room configuration helpers.

See the Wiki for a deep dive, code walkthroughs, and examples.

### 🚀 Quick Start

1) Install Ren'Py 8.4.x and set your SDK path. Example:
   - export RENPY_SDK=~/renpy-8.4.1-sdk
2) Run the project:
   - **Recommended**: `scripts/run-game.sh` (unified launcher with linting)
   - **Direct**: `$RENPY_SDK/renpy.sh .`
3) Development workflow:
   - `scripts/run-game.sh --lint` (lint then launch)
   - `scripts/run-game.sh --debug` (launch with console output)
   - `scripts/run-game.sh --help` (show all options)
4) Build distributions via Ren'Py Launcher → Build & Distribute.

*See `DEVELOPMENT_TOOLS.md` for complete development workflow documentation*

### 🎮 Controls (Default)

* A/Enter/Space: interact (open action menu)
* Arrow keys / WASD: navigate objects
* Esc/B: cancel
* Mouse: hover/click objects

### 🧠 Core Concepts

* Hooks: write gameplay as Python/renpy functions responding to events:

```renpy
# Implement these in game/logic/game_logic.rpy (or per-room handlers)
def on_game_start():
    ...

def on_room_enter(room_id):
    ...

def on_object_hover(room_id, obj):
    ...

def on_object_interact(room_id, obj, action) -> bool:
    # Return True when you fully handle an action
    ...
```

* Per‑room Logic: implement `register_room_logic('<room>', Handler())` with your own methods.
* APIs: use `room_api`, `ui_api`, `interactions_api`, `display_api` instead of scattering logic in screens.
* Logging: centralized logging interception with color and truncation; toggles available at runtime.
