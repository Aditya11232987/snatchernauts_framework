# Publish checklist (itch.io)

1) Create or edit your project on itch.io
- Project kind: Tools (or Game, if you want broader discovery)
- Status: Early access or Released (your choice)
- Pricing: Free (recommended) or set a price; enable donations if desired

2) Upload cover/banner, GIF, and screenshots
- Use Wiki/snatcher-logo.png as the cover/banner per rules
- Upload marketing/itchio/snatchernauts-overview.gif (animated preview)
- Add 2–4 screenshots (you already have Wiki/screenshots/shot1.png … shot5.png; pick the best 3–4 or include all)
- After upload, copy the hosted URLs (right-click → Copy image address)

3) Paste the description
- Open marketing/itchio/page_description.md
- Replace placeholders: {{BANNER_URL}}, {{OVERVIEW_GIF_URL}}, {{SHOT1_URL}}, {{SHOT2_URL}}, {{SHOT3_URL}}, {{SHOT4_URL}} (from Wiki/screenshots/shot1.png … shot4.png)
- Paste the content into the project “Description” field

4) Optional: Apply custom CSS theme
- Open marketing/itchio/theme.css
- On itch.io → Edit theme → Custom CSS → Paste
- Save and preview. If selectors change, remove lines that break and keep base typography blocks

5) Metadata
- Engine: Ren’Py
- Platforms: Windows, Linux, macOS (if you plan to ship templates or demos)
- Tags: tool, engine, framework, visual-novel, renpy, retro, adventure
- Release notes: paste from CHANGELOG if desired

6) Visibility and community
- Set page to Public or Restricted (unlisted) as needed
- Optionally enable comments or Devlog

7) Test
- Open the public page in a private window
- Verify fonts look monospace and compact
- Check images, links, and any download buttons

8) Maintain
- Keep this directory updated; commit changes with the same version as the framework
