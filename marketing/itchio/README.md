# Snatchernauts Framework — itch.io materials

This directory contains versioned content for creating and maintaining a custom itch.io page for Snatchernauts Framework.

Contents
- page_description.md — ready-to-paste description (Markdown + HTML-safe)
- theme.css — optional custom styles (for itch.io theme editor, if enabled)
- checklist.md — step-by-step publishing checklist

Notes
- Image hosting: itch.io requires images to be uploaded to the page to get hosted URLs. Replace placeholders like {{BANNER_URL}} and {{SCREENSHOT_1}} after uploading.
- Banner preference: per project rules, use Wiki/snatcher-logo.png as the banner/logo on the page.
- Sanitization: itch.io sanitizes CSS/HTML. Inline styles in page_description.md are conservative and typically allowed, but arbitrary CSS may be stripped unless using the Theme editor.
