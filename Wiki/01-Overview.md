# Overview

> <b>Vision:</b> VN storytelling — with the tactile, exploratory spirit of <i>Snatcher</i> and <i>Policenauts</i>.

Snatchernauts extends Ren'Py with a structured, room‑based exploration layer. You write gameplay through simple hooks and APIs; the framework handles UI composition, object navigation, and effects.

<b>Core pillars</b>
- 🧭 Interactivity first: hover/selection/menus for in‑room objects
- 🧹 Clean separation: logic in .rpy hooks, UI via screens, helpers via API modules
- 🎞️ Cinematic presentation: CRT/Bloom/Letterbox and info/debug overlays
- 🤝 Friendly defaults: sensible behaviors but easy to override

<b>Beyond generic Ren'Py</b>
- 🎯 Pixel‑accurate hotspots and object navigation
- 🧩 Centralized lifecycle hooks for gameplay
- 🧰 Public APIs (room/display/ui/interactions) to avoid screen spaghetti
- 🛠️ Built‑in debug tooling with runtime logging toggles
