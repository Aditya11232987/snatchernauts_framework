# Screens & UI

- Exploration screen orchestrates hover/selection, description box, and action menu
- Info overlay appears at startup and can be toggled later
- Debug overlay cycles through hidden → compact → verbose

Customization
- Tweak styles and sizes in `game/ui/` and `game/overlays/`
- Add transforms/transitions to taste
