# Legacy Scripts

This folder contains legacy entry points and placeholders retained for compatibility and historical context.

- `room_main.rpy` – legacy label `explore_room`; prefer `label play_room` in `game/script.rpy`.
- `room_functions.rpy` – placeholder; room functions live in `game/api/room_api.rpy` now.

These scripts are still loaded by Ren'Py but should not be used by new code.
